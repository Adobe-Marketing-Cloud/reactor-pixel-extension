# Pixel Creator Extension for Launch, by Adobe

This repository is for the [Adobe Experience Platform Launch](https://www.adobe.com/experience-platform/launch.html) extension that provides a template for creating pixels. Change the `new Image().src` to your site's host/path, and allow users who download your extension to enter their campaign and create a pixel on their URL.

For more information about developing an extension for Launch, please visit our [extension development guide](https://developer.adobelaunch.com/extensions/).
